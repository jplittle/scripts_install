# make a change to a file on the local computer - then do git "commit -a"
# git pull https://github.com/jplittle/path_2_repo
#### after changes made to a file, must use git commit, then git push
#When you change a file which is already in the repository, you have to git add it again if you want it to be staged.

# This allows you to commit only a subset of the changes you made since the last commit. 
# For example, let's say you have file a, file b and file c. You modify file a and 
# file b but the changes are very different in nature and you don't want all of them to be in one single commit. You issue

git add a
git commit a -m "bugfix, in a"
git add b
git commit b -m "new feature, in b"
As a side note, if you want to commit everything you can just type

git commit -a
